# JSX and React
This repository serves to document my learning of JSX and React. This is a very simple application to simulate comments posted on a page, with approval and reject buttons. The purpose of this exercise is to use Components and Props in React.

## What I Have Used

**React and JSX**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**faker**
To generate random content for the comments.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
